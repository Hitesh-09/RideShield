## Overview

Param Setu is a **next-generation parametric insurance platform** designed to protect gig and delivery workers from income disruptions caused by environmental risks such as rain, heatwaves, and air pollution.

Unlike traditional insurance systems that rely on manual claim filing and lengthy verification processes, Param Setu leverages **real-time data, automated triggers, and intelligent risk pricing** to deliver **instant payouts without human intervention**.

---

## Problem Statement

Delivery workers are highly vulnerable to:

- Heavy rainfall  
- Extreme heat conditions  
- Poor air quality  

These conditions directly impact their daily earnings.

However, existing insurance solutions are:

- ❌ Manual and slow  
- ❌ Claim-heavy and complex  
- ❌ Not designed for gig workers  

---

## Solution

Param Setu introduces a **fully automated parametric insurance system** where:

✔ No claim filing  
✔ No manual verification  
✔ Instant financial protection  

---

## Key Features

### Automated Event Engine
- Continuously monitors real-world conditions  
- Uses OpenWeather APIs for:
  - Rainfall  
  - Temperature  
  - Air Quality (AQI)  
- Runs in the background to detect trigger events  

---

### Instant Parametric Claims
- Claims are triggered automatically  
- Fixed payout per event  
- No paperwork or delays  

---

### Multi-Trigger Support
- Rain-based triggers  
- Heatwave triggers  
- Pollution (AQI) triggers  

---

### AI-Based Premium Calculation
- Dynamic pricing using a rule-based risk engine  
- Factors:
  - Rainfall  
  - Temperature  
  - AQI  
- Outputs:
  - Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)  
  - Weekly Premium  

---

### Fraud Prevention System
- Prevents duplicate claims  
- Uses trusted external APIs for validation  
- Fully automated system eliminates manual manipulation  

---

### Rider Dashboard (User App)
- Simple login/register flow  
- Displays:
  - Premium  
  - Risk level  
  - Daily coverage  
- Shows automatic payouts in real-time  

---

### Admin Dashboard
- Monitor users, policies, and claims  
- Track system activity  
- View triggered events and payouts  

---

## System Architecture

User → Policy Creation → Risk Engine → Event Engine → Claim Engine → Database

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|--------|-----------|
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Frontend | Streamlit (User + Admin dashboards) |
| APIs | OpenWeather (Weather + AQI) |
| AI Logic | Rule-based risk engine |
| Automation | Background event engine |
| Testing | Postman |
| Version Control | GitHub |

---

## How It Works

1. User registers on the platform  
2. Policy is created with **AI-calculated premium**  
3. System continuously monitors environmental data  
4. If a trigger condition is met:
   - Claim is generated automatically  
   - Payout is credited instantly  

---

## Policy Logic & Exclusions

- Claims are triggered only when predefined thresholds are met  
- No duplicate payouts for the same event  
- Coverage is location-based  
- Only verified external data sources are used
